# Google Play Store EDA  

A comprehensive *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* of the *Google Play Store Apps dataset* covering 2.3M+ apps.  
This project explores app categories, installs, ratings, reviews, pricing, developer activity, and release trends to uncover meaningful insights into the mobile app ecosystem.  


##  Project Aim  
The goal of this EDA is to:  
- Analyze app popularity through installs & user ratings  
- Explore category dominance & trends  
- Compare free vs. paid apps and pricing models  
- Study developer activity & publishing patterns  
- Understand release years & update frequencies  


##  Workflow  
1. *Data Cleaning & Preparation*  
   - Standardized installs, ratings, app size & dates  
   - Handled missing values & removed duplicates  

2. *Feature Engineering*  
   - Install bins, free/paid flags, freshness indicators  
   - Estimated potential revenue  

3. *Exploratory Analysis*  
   - Univariate, bivariate & multivariate analysis  
   - Outlier detection & handling  

4. *Visualization*  
   - Insights with Matplotlib, Seaborn & Plotly (interactive)  

##  Key Insights  
- *Long-Tail Engagement* → ~98% of apps have <10K ratings; very few dominate.  
- *Utility Apps Lead* → Tools, Communication & Productivity top install counts.  
- *Niche Genres Win Ratings* → Role Playing, Casino & Simulation score highest.  
- *Paid Apps Edge* → Slightly higher average ratings vs. free apps.  
- *Weak Predictors* → App size & price show negligible effect on ratings.  
- *Release Trends* → Launches peaked in 2020, declined afterward.  
- *Revenue Concentration* → Casual games & productivity tools drive most revenue.

## Tech Stack  
- Python (Pandas, Numpy)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- Jupyter Notebook  


## Conclusion & Next Steps  
This EDA provides clear insights into app popularity, quality, monetization, and lifecycle trends, empowering developers, analysts, and businesses for data-driven decisions.  

*Next steps:*  
- Predictive modeling for installs/ratings  
- Clustering & segmentation of apps  
- Time-series forecasting of launches & updates  
- Prototype recommender system  
- Interactive dashboard with key KPIs  


 This project demonstrates how *structured EDA* transforms raw app data into actionable strategies for growth, optimization, and product success.
